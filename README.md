# encryption
This project uses a basic hexadcimal encryptiona nd decryption of plain-text english messages. 
In encryption algorithm it reads a file with some message and asks user to enter a hexadecimal key of his choice, then it encrypts the message and stores it in a file.
In decyption algorithm, program does the same exact thing but this time user uses an already encrypted file to read and retreive the plain-text message again.
Please NOTE: the plain text english messages do not take into account "carriage returns" at this time. So for sake of ease please try to use plain text, numeric, space character, and simple punctuation that can be converted into hexadecimal.
Also for ease of testing the repository includes a sample english text file that can be used for testing.
