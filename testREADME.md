# Testing

In this testing I used the enc.py and "actual.txt" message file to encrypt a message into "enc.txt" by using "013F" as my key.
Then I retreived the message by using dec.py by recalling the "enc.txt" and storing retreived message in "ret.txt" by using the same "013F" key.

Please follow the same steps to verify the functionality or try your own! 

Regards,
